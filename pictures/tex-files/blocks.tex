\large
Observation of absolutely elastic collisions of two blocks with the wall and between themselves may lead to grandiose results. Let the mass of the first block (that is located closer to the wall) be equal to one conventional unit and of the second block to ${100}^{d-1}$ conventional units. It turns out that the number of their collisions allows to precisely compute first $d$ digits of $\pi$!
